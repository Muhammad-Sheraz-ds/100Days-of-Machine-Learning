    "Feature engineering refers to a process of selecting and transforming variables/features in your dataset when creating a predictive model using machine learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is Feature Selection?\n",
    "Feature selection is the process where you automatically or manually select the features that contribute the most to your prediction variable or output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone can just pass data from models using sklearn or do automl stuffs using pycaret or any other python library but the idea is what will make the winners different from rest of us so answer is very simple: feature engineering and selection phases of machine learning pipeline will.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that there are different ways to represent attributes in a model, and that some of these representations are better than others, leads to the idea of feature engineering - the process of creating representations of data that increase the effectiveness of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that model effectiveness is influenced by many things. Obviously, if the attribute has no relationship to the outcome then its representation is irrelevant. However, it is very important to realize that there are a multitude of types of models and that each has its own sensitivities and needs. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some models cannot tolerate attributes that measure the same underlying quantity (i.e., multicollinearity or correlation between attributes).\n",
    "- Many models cannot use samples with any missing values.\n",
    "- Some models are severely compromised when irrelevant attributes are in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering and variable selection can help mitigate many of these issues. The goal of this notebook is to help practitioners build better models by focusing on the attributes. “Better” depends on the context of the problem but most likely involves the following factors: accuracy, simplicity, and robustness. To achieve these characteristics, or to make good trade-offs between them, it is critical to understand the interplay between attributes used in a model and the type of model. Accuracy and/or simplicity can sometimes be improved by representing data in ways that are more palatable to the model or by reducing the number of variables used."

    "These visualizations provide insights that should be used to inform the initial models. It is important to note that some of the most useful visualizations for exploring the data are not necessarily complex or difficult to create. In fact, a simple scatter plot can elicit insights that a model may not be able to uncover, and can lead to the creation of a new attributes or to a transformation of a attributes or the output that improves model performance. The challenge here lies in developing intuition for knowing how to visually explore data to extract information for improvement.\n",

For a continuous attribute such as the Free Sulfur Dioxide attribute, it is important to understand if the attribute has a symmetric distribution, if the distribution has a decreasing frequency of larger observations (i.e., the distribution is skewed), if the distribution appears to be made up of two or more individual distributions (i.e., the distribution has multiple peaks or modes), or if there appears to be unusually low or high observations (i.e outliers).\n",

In addition to the box on a box plot, there can be lines (which are called whiskers) extending from the box indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, thus, the plot is also termed as the box-and-whisker plot and the box-and-whisker diagram.

    "A histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges. Similar in appearance to a bar graph, the histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are commonly used in statistics to demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occurs within a specific range. For example, a census focused on the demography of a country may use a histogram to show how many people are between the ages of 0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, 31 - 40, 41 - 50, etc. This histogram would look similar to the example below."

    "Attributes which are continuous are subject to have problems with modeling process. For example, models that construct relationships between the attributes and the output that are based on the rank of the attribute values rather than the actual value, like trees, are immune to attribute distributions that are skewed or to individual samples that have unusual values (i.e., outliers). Other models such as K-nearest neighbors and support vector machines are much more sensitive to attributes with skewed distributions or outliers. Continuous attributes that are highly correlated with each other is another regularly occurring scenario that presents a problem for some models but not for others.\n",

The first type of transformations to a single attribute discussed here are those that change the scale of the data. A good example is the transformation described in plot below. In that case, the attribute residual sugar had very skewed distributions and it was shown that using the inverse of the log values improves distribution."

As you can see, the Box-Cox transformation is quite flexible in its ability to address many different data distributions. \n",

    "Also, note that both transformations are unsupervised since, in this application, the outcome is not used in the computations. While the transformation might improve the attribute distribution, it has no guarantee of improving the model. However, there are a variety of parametric models that utilize polynomial calculations on the attribute data, such as most linear models, neural networks, and support vector machines. In these situations, a skewed attribute distribution can have a harmful effect on these models since the tails of the distribution can dominate the underlying calculations.\n"

    "Another common technique for modifying the scale of a predictor is to standardize its value in order to have specific properties. Centering a predictor is a common technique. The predictor’s training set average is subtracted from the predictor’s individual values. When this is applied separately to each variable, the collection of variables would have a common mean value (i.e., zero). Similarly, scaling is the process of dividing a variable by the corresponding training set’s standard deviation. This ensures that that variables have a standard deviation of one. \n",

    "Alternatively, range scaling uses the training set minimum and maximum values to translate the data to be within an arbitrary range (usually zero and one). Again, it is emphasized that the statistics required for the transformation (e.g., the mean) are estimated from the training set and are applied to all data sets (e.g., the test set or new samples). These transformations are mostly innocuous and are typically needed when the model requires the predictors to be in common units. For example, when the distance or dot products between predictors are used (such as K-nearest neighbors or support vector machines) a standardization procedure is essential."

The b(b0, b1 and, b2) values could be estimated using basic linear regression. If the true trend were linear, the rest one regression parameters would presumably be near zero (at least relative to their standard error). Also, the linear regression used to determine the coefficients for the basis expansion could be estimated in the presence of other regressors. \n",

    "This type of basis expansion, where the pattern is applied globally to the attribute, can often be insufficient. Because at some local point trends may be increase but according to global function(basis expansion) it is decreasing in nature. An alternative method to creating a global basis function that can be used in a regression model is a **polynomial spline**. \n",

    "Binning, also known as categorization or discretization, is the process of translating a quantitative variable into a set of two or more qualitative buckets (i.e., categories). For example, a variable might be translated into quantiles; the buckets would be for whether the numbers fell into the first 25% of the data, between the 25th and median, etc. In this case, there would be four distinct values of the binned version\n",
    "of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few apparent reasons for subjecting the data to such a transformation:\n",
    "- Some feel that it simplifies the analysis and/or interpretation of the results.\n",
    "Suppose that a person’s age was a predictor and this was binned by whether\n",
    "someone was above 40 years old or not. One might be able to make a statement\n",
    "that there is a 25% increase in the probability of the event between younger\n",
    "and older people. There is no discussion of per-unit increases in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binning may avoid the problem of having to specify the relationship between\n",
    "the predictor and outcome. A set of bins can be perceived as being able to model more patterns without having to visualize or think about the underlying pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using qualitative versions of the attributes may give the perception that it\n",
    "reduces the variation in the data. Unfortunately, this artificial reduction in variation can lead to a high false positive\n",
    "rate when the predictor is unrelated to the outcome.\n",
    "\n",

    "Question may arise why PCA in Feature Engineering? Specifically, the objective of PCA is to find linear combinations of the original attributes such that the combinations summarize the maximal amount of variation in the original predictor space. From a statistical perspective, variation is synonymous with information. So, by finding combinations of the original attributes that capture variation, we find the subspace of the data that contains the information relevant to the attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis is an effective dimension reduction technique when\n",
    "attributes are linearly correlated and when the resulting scores are associated with the\n",
    "outcome. Consider the following equation \n",
    "\n",
    "y = $x_1$ + $x_2^2$ + $x_1^2$ + $x_2$ + noise  \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose also that the correlation between x1 and x2 is strong. Applying traditional PCA to this example would summarize the relationship between x1 and x2 into one principal component. However this approach would ignore the important quadratic relationships that would be critically necessary for predicting the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore traditional PCA will be a much less effective dimension reduction technique when the data should be augmented with additional\n",
    "features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we knew that one or more quadratic terms were necessary for explaining the\n",
    "outcome, then these terms could be added to the attributes to be evaluated in the\n",
    "modeling process. Another approach would be to use a nonlinear basis expansion as\n",
    "described earlier in this notebook. A third possible approach is **kernel PCA**. The kernel PCA approach combines\n",
    "a specific mathematical view of PCA with kernel functions and the kernel ‘trick’\n",
    "to enable PCA to expand the dimension of the predictor space in which dimension\n",
    "reduction is performed (not unlike basis expansions).\n",
