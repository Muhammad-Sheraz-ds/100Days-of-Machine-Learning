# Module 10: Overview of Deep Learning

### Deep learning is a branch of machine learning. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms, many of which have a finite capacity to learn no matter how much data they acquire, deep learning systems can improve their performance with access to more data: the machine version of more experience. After machines have gained enough experience through deep learning, they can be put to work for specific tasks such as driving a car, detecting weeds in a field of crops, detecting diseases, inspecting machinery to identify faults, and so on.
