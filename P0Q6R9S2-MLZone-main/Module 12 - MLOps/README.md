# Module 12: MLOps

# MLOps
- MLOps stands for **Machine Learning Operations**.
- MLOps is an engineering discipline that aims to unify ML systems development (Dev) and ML systems deployment (Ops) in order to standardize and streamline the continuous delivery of high-performing models in production.
- MLOps is a collaborative function, often comprising data scientists, devops engineers, and IT.
- **MLOps involves various practices, such as:**
  - Data versioning and management
  - Model training and testing
  - Model deployment and monitoring
  - Model lifecycle management
  - Model governance and compliance
- **MLOps can help overcome common challenges in ML projects, such as:**
  - Data drift and model decay
  - Reproducibility and traceability
  - Scalability and reliability
  - Collaboration and communication
  - Security and privacy
