    "            - Lastly, when the learning of the final hidden layer is accomplished, then the whole DBN is trained.\n",
    "   - Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "        - It permits parallel as well as sequential computation, and it is exactly similar to that of the human brain (large feedback network of connected neurons). Since they are capable enough to reminisce all of the imperative things related to the input they have received, so they are more precise.\n"
